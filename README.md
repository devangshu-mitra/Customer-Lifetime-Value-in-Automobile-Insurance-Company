# Factors Affecting Customer Lifetime Value in Automobile Insurance

This repository hosts the project files for the Applied Econometrics Group 2's analysis of factors affecting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the automobile insurance sector. Our project employs econometric and machine learning techniques to identify and quantify the impacts of various factors on CLV, providing insights that could help insurance companies enhance their customer value management strategies.

## Data
Source of Data:
The dataset utilized in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranja7/vehicle-insurance-customer-data/data, comprising information on customer interactions and transactions. The data spans a range of attributes, offering insights into customer profiles, policies, claims, and various other factors that contribute to the understanding of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) within the insurance industry. The data set is quite complete with twenty four variables and 9,134 observations per variable.


## Project Files

- `CLV_Factor_Analysis_Report.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and interpretation of results.
- `Insurance CLV Database.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

## Overview

The global automobile insurance market is vast and growing, driven by an increasing number of vehicles and awareness of insurance benefits. In this context, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) emerges as a critical metric, quantifying the long-term economic value a company can expect from a customer relationship. Our project explores the factors influencing CLV in the automobile insurance sector, using a dataset from Kaggle comprising customer profiles, policy details, and transaction records.

## Key Findings

- **Statistical Significance**: Variables such as Monthly Premium Auto, Number of Open Complaints, Number of Policies, and Total Claim Amount have statistically significant impacts on CLV.
- **Economic Implications**: Our analysis reveals how each of these variables influences CLV, offering actionable insights for insurance companies to optimize their strategies.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employing multiple linear regression, we developed a model that explains a significant portion of the variance in CLV, demonstrating the complex interplay of factors affecting customer value in the insurance industry.
